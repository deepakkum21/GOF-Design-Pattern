# Behavior Design Patterns
## Chain of Responsibility. 
Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
## Command. 
Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
## Interpreter. 
Implements a specialized language.
## Iterator. 
Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
## Mediator. 
Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
## Memento. 
Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
## Observer. 
Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
## State. 
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
## Strategy.
Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
## Template Method.
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
## Visitor. 
Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
